                <p class="services-txt">Deep Tissue Massage reaches deeper layers of muscles. It is used to break down
                    knots and relieve
                    pressure points throughout the body. This massage is beneficial for athletes and those who sit for
                    long periods of time. </p>

                <p class="services-txt">The goal of Swedish Massage is to melt away muscle tension and increase the
                    blood flow to your heart. Swedish Massage is extremely therapeutic as it decreases muscle toxins,
                    increases oxygen levels in the blood, and improves flexibility in the body. </p>

                    used with oils to sooth, warm, and massage your muscles. This allows your body to relax and release
                    tension and stress. </p>

                <p class="services-txt">Myofascial Release is a safe and very effective hands-on technique that involves
                    applying gentle sustained pressure into the Myofascial connective tissue restrictions to eliminate
                    pain and restore motion.</p>

                <p class="services-title">Trigger Point</p>
                <p class="services-txt">Trigger point therapy is a bodywork technique that involves the application of
                    pressure to tender muscle tissue in order to relieve pain and dysfunction in other parts of the
                    body. Trigger point massage therapy releases constricted areas and is similar to deep tissue
                    massage. This type of therapy may not be a relaxing process but it can significantly relax your
                    muscles and release tension. </p>

                <p class="services-txt">Our feet do a lot of work. The support the weight of our bodies and allow
                    locomotion. And yet, they are the least pampered part of our bodies. Just like your neck, back, and
                    shoulders, your feet can also benefit from a regular rubdown. Foot massage improves circulation,
                    stimulates muscles, reduces tension, and often eases pain.</p>

                    of time. Chair massage is done while you are seated and fully clothed in a portable, specially
                    designed chair. During a chair massage, your therapist will focus on your neck, shoulders, back,

                <p class="services-txt">Aromatherapy massage is Swedish massage therapy using massage oil that contains
                    essential oils (highly concentrated plant oils). During an aromatherapy massage, you inhale these
                    essential oil molecules or absorb them through your skin. They are thought to promote beneficial
                    changes in your mind and body by affecting the limbic system, a region of the brain known to
                    influence the nervous system. Different essential oils have effects including: calming, energizing,
                    uplifting mood, decongesting.</p>
